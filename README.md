<h1>How to play</h1>
In this version of the Battleship game, the player determines the grid size and the number of ships to sink. Once both numbers are entered (which must be greater than 2 and 0, respectively), two grids are generatedâ€”one for the user and one for the computer.
Guesses are marked on the board with an X and. Hits are indicated by *.
